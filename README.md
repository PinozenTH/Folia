## This is a Fork of folia
This fork of Folia is specifically tailored for downloading artifacts and implementing custom features for my server. It is not intended for general use or distribution. The modifications made here are designed to meet the unique requirements of my server environment.

Key points:
- This is a personal fork for specific server needs
- Contains custom implementations not present in the original Folia
- Not recommended for use by others without understanding the modifications
- May diverge from the main Folia project over time

Please be aware that this fork may not receive updates from the original Folia project and could become outdated. Use at your own risk and always backup your data before making any changes to your server.
